Challenge yourself to drink more water for better health! Health experts recommend drinking at least a half gallon (8 cups) of water every day. Drinking enough water can help you lose weight by controlling your appetite, boosting your metabolism, and aiding your digestion.

Is 8 cups a day too easy for you? Aim for a whole gallon of water! In the 30-day water challenge, you challenge yourself to drink a gallon of water every day for 30 days straight. People who have completed this challenge report a wide range of beneficial results, such as weight loss, more energy, less headaches, better mood, softer hair, and healthier looking skin. Some celebrities such as Beyonce drink a gallon a day, which could possibly be how they always look flawless!

With the Gallon Challenge watchapp for Pebble, you can help yourself drink more water by keeping count of how much water you drink each day, and keeping track of how many days in a row you've met your goal. The app also keeps track of statistics such as the total amount of water you've recorded consuming and the length of your longest streak.

You can customize your drinking goal to be either a half gallon or whole gallon of water each day. The unit that you drink in can be customized to either ounces, cups, pints, or quarts. You can change the hour that your day starts at in case you have an irregular schedule.
